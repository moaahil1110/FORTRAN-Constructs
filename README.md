A mini-project developed for AFLL (Automata, Formal Languages, and Logic) that demonstrates lexical analysis and syntax parsing for FORTRAN constructs using Python's PLY (Python Lex-Yacc) library.

## Overview:

This project implements:
- Lexical analyzer (Lexer) for FORTRAN code structure
- Syntax parser (Parser) using context-free grammar rules
- Error handling for syntax violations

## Features:

- Supports basic FORTRAN IV constructs:
  - Variable declarations (INTEGER, REAL)
  - Arithmetic operations
  - DO loops and nested control structures
  - IF-THEN-ELSE conditional statements
  - Basic I/O operations
- PLY-based implementation for both lexing and parsing
- Detailed error reporting with line numbers
- Sample FORTRAN programs for testing
